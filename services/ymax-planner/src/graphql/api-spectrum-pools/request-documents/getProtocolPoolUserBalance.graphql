"""Get the balances for an arbitrary number of deployed pool positions.

Each position is identified by a blockchain (for EVM chains, a
`0x${upaddedLowercaseHexDigits}` representation of their EIP-155 CHAIN_ID [cf.
https://chainlist.org/ ]), protocol, pool within that protocol (corresponding
with e.g. an associated token, cf.
https://spectrumnodes.gitbook.io/docs/developer-guides/apis/pools-api/supported-pools
), and address.

Note that the output `balance` is an object, from which you probably want the
"USDC" property (a floating-point number, each unit of which is 1e6 uudc).
