/**
 * @typedef {Passable} Key
 * Keys are pass-by-copy structures (CopyArray, CopyRecord,
 * CopySet, CopyBag, CopyMap) that end in either passable primitive data or
 * Remotables (Far objects or their remote presences.) Keys are so named
 * because they can be used as keys in MapStores and CopyMaps, as well as
 * the elements of CopySets and CopyBags.
 *
 * Keys cannot contain promises or errors, as these do not have a useful
 * distributed equality semantics. Keys also cannot contain any CopyTagged
 * except for those recognized as CopySets, CopyBags, and CopyMaps.
 *
 * Be aware that we may recognize more CopyTaggeds over time, including
 * CopyTaggeds recognized as keys.
 *
 * Distributed equality is location independent.
 * The same two keys, passed to another location, will be equal there iff
 * they are equal here.
 */

/**
 * @typedef {Passable} Pattern
 * Patterns are pass-by-copy structures (CopyArray, CopyRecord,
 * CopySet, CopyBag, CopyMap) that end in either Keys or Matchers. Each pattern
 * acts as a declarative passable predicate over passables, where each passable
 * either passes a given pattern, or does not. Every key is also a pattern.
 * Used as a pattern, a key matches only "itself", i.e., keys that are equal
 * to it according to the key distributed equality semantics.
 *
 * Patterns cannot contain promises or errors, as these do
 * not have a useful distributed equality or matching semantics. Likewise,
 * no pattern can distinguish among promises, or distinguish among errors.
 * Patterns also cannot contain any CopyTaggeds except for those recognized as
 * CopySets, CopyBags, CopyMaps, or Matchers.
 *
 * Be aware that we may recognize more CopyTaggeds over time, including
 * CopyTaggeds recognized as patterns.
 *
 * Whether a passable matches a given pattern is location independent.
 * For a passable and a pattern, both passed to another location, the passable
 * will match the pattern there iff the passable matches that pattern here.
 *
 * Patterns are often used in a type-like manner, to represent the category
 * of passables that are intended* to match that pattern. To keep this
 * distinction clear, we often use the suffix "Shape" rather than "Pattern"
 * to avoid the levels confusion when the pattern itself represents
 * some category of pattern. For example, an "AmountShape" represents the
 * category of Amounts. And "AmountPatternShape" represents the
 * category of patterns over Amounts.
 *
 * * I say "intended" above because Patterns, in order to be declarative
 * and passable, cannot have the generality of predicates written in a
 * Turing-universal programming language. Rather, to represent the category of
 * things intended to be a Foo, a FooShape should reliably
 * accept all Foos and reject only non-Foos. However, a FooShape may also accept
 * non-Foos that "look like" or have "the same shape as" genuine Foos. To write
 * as accurate predicate, for use, for example, for input validation, would
 * need to supplement the pattern check with code to check for the residual
 * cases.
 * We hope the "Shape" metaphore helps remind us of this type-like imprecision
 * of patterns.

/**

 * This comparison function is valid as argument to

 * but, depending on your definitions, this is technically incorrect because
 * it may return `0` to indicate that two distinguishable elements such as
 * `-0` and `0` are tied (i.e., are in the same equivalence class
 * for the purposes of this ordering). If each such equivalence class is
 * a *rank* and ranks are disjoint, then this "rank order" is a
 * true total order over these ranks. In mathematics this goes by several
 * other names such as "total preorder".
 *
 * This function establishes a total rank order over all passables.
 * To do so it makes arbitrary choices, such as that all strings
 * are after all numbers. Thus, this order is not intended to be
 * used directly as a comparison with useful semantics. However, it must be
 * closely enough related to such comparisons to aid in implementing
 * lookups based on those comparisons. For example, in order to get a total
 * order among ranks, we put `NaN` after all other JavaScript "number" values
 * (i.e., IEEE 754 floating-point values). But otherwise, we rank JavaScript
 * numbers by signed magnitude, with `0` and `-0` tied. A semantically useful
 * ordering would also compare magnitudes, and so agree with the rank ordering
 * of all values other than `NaN`. An array sorted by rank would enable range
 * queries by magnitude.

/**
 * @callback KeyCompare
 * `compareKeys` implements a partial order over keys. As with the
 * rank ordering produced by `compareRank`, -1, 0, and 1 mean
 * "less than", "equivalent to", and "greater than" respectively.
 * NaN means "incomparable" --- the first key is not less, equivalent,
 * or greater than the second. For example, subsets over sets is
 * a partial order.
 *
 * By using NaN for "incomparable", the normal equivalence for using
 * the return value in a comparison is preserved.
 * `compareKeys(left, right) >= 0` iff `left` is greater than or
 * equivalent to `right` in the partial ordering.
 *
 * Key order (a partial order) and rank order (a total preorder) are
 * co-designed so that we store passables in rank order and index into them
 * with keys for key-based queries. To keep these distinct, when speaking
 * informally about rank, we talk about "earlier" and "later". When speaking
 * informally about keys, we talk about "smaller" and "bigger".
 *
 * In both orders, the return-0 case defines
 * an equivalence class, i.e., those that are tied for the same place in the
 * order. The global invariant that we need between the two orders is that the
 * key order equivalence class is always at least as precise as the
 * rank order equivalence class. IOW, if `compareKeys(X,Y) === 0` then
 * `compareRank(X,Y) === 0`. But not vice versa. For example, two different
 * remotables are the same rank but incomparable as keys.
 *
 * A further invariant is if `compareKeys(X,Y) < 0` then
 * `compareRank(X,Y) < 0`, i.e., if X is smaller than Y in key order, then X
 * must be earlier than Y in rank order. But not vice versa.
 * X can be equivalent to or earlier than Y in rank order and still be
 * incomparable with Y in key order. For example, the record `{b: 3, a: 5}` is
 * earlier than the record `{b: 5, a: 3}` in rank order but they are
 * incomparable as keys. And two distinct remotables such as `Far('X', {})` and
 * `Far('Y', {})` are equivalent in rank order but incomparable as keys.
 *
 * This lets us translate a range search over the
 * partial key order into a range search over rank order followed by filtering
 * out those that don't match. To get this effect, we store the elements of
 * a set in an array sorted in reverse rank order, from later to earlier.
 * Combined with our lexicographic comparison of arrays, if set X is a subset
 * of set Y then the array representing set X will be an earlier rank that the
 * array representing set Y.
