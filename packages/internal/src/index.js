// NOTE: Because @endo/bundle-source does not do tree-shaking (at least as of
// September 2025), bundles for sources that import from '@agoric/internal' will
// include each of these files even if none of their own exports are used.
// To keep the size of bundles down, deep imports from @agoric/internal are
// preferred.
// HOWEVER, there are still occasional imports of '@agoric/internal', so be
// judicious about what to include here!
