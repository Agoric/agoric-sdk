# xsnap

Xsnap is a utility for taking resumable snapshots of a running JavaScript
worker, using Moddableâ€™s XS JavaScript engine.

Xsnap provides a Node.js API for controlling Xsnap workers.

```js
const worker = await xsnap({
  variant: 'latest', // default: 'legacy'
});
await worker.evaluate(`
  // Incrementer, running on XS.
  function handleCommand(message) {
    const number = parseInt(new TextDecoder().decode(message), 10);
    return new TextEncoder().encode(`${number + 1}`).buffer;
  }
`);
await fs.writeFile('bootstrap.xss', worker.makeSnapshotStream());
await worker.close();
```

Some time later, possibly on a different computerâ€¦

```js
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
const worker = await xsnap({
  snapshotStream: fs.createFileStream('bootstrap.xss'),
});
const response = await worker.issueCommand('1');
console.log(decoder.decode(response)); // 2
await worker.close();
```

The parent and child communicate using "commands".

- The XS child uses the synchronous `issueCommand` function to send a request
  and receive as response from the Node.js parent.
- The XS child can implement a synchronous `handleCommand` function to respond
  to commands from the Node.js parent.
  - The XS child `handleCommand` may be asynchronous after a fashion: it
    may return an object and, before the promise queue becomes empty,
    set the `result` property of this object to an `ArrayBuffer`.
    See the **evaluate and report** test for an example.
- The Node.js parent uses an asynchronous `issueCommand` method to send a
  request and receive a response from the XS child.
- The Node.js parent can implement an asynchronous `handleCommand` function to
  respond to commands from the XS child.

# Compatibility

The `variant` is either `"legacy"` or `"latest"`.
For purposes of backward-compatibility, the `"legacy"` variant ensures
that all future versions of `xsnap` will read snapshots created by any
prior version produced by the `"legacy"` variant.

By contrast, the `"latest"` variant should not be asked to read snapshots
produced by any previous version of `xsnap`, and in exchange, may have
new features and changes in behavior including observably different behavior
due to bug fixes.

# Installation

Installation of this package from npm depends on the target system's C
toolchain, albeit gcc or clang.
The toolchains provided on MacOS and Linux as installed with developer tools at
the time of writing are sufficient to the task but breaking changes to the C
toolchain and system libraries may disrupt the installability of xsnap in
future versions.

# xsrepl

With `xsnap` comes an `xsrepl` command line tool.
Use `yarn global add @agoric/xsnap` to add `xsrepl` to your path.
During development, run `yarn repl`.

The REPL supports special commands `load` and `save` for snapshots, and `quit`
to quit.
Load and save don't take arguments; just type the file name on the next prompt.

```console
$ xsrepl
xs> globalThis.x = 42;
xs> x
42
xs> save
file> temp.xss
xs> quit
```

```console
$ xsrepl
xs> load
file> temp.xss
xs> x
42
xs> quit
```
