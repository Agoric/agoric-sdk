 *   Amounts are descriptions of digital assets, answering the questions "how
 *   much" and "of what kind". Amounts are values labeled with a brand.
 *   AmountMath executes the logic of how amounts are changed when digital
 *   assets are merged, separated, or otherwise manipulated. For example, a
 *   deposit of 2 bucks into a purse that already has 3 bucks gives a new purse
 *   balance of 5 bucks. An empty purse has 0 bucks. AmountMath relies heavily
 *   on polymorphic MathHelpers, which manipulate the unbranded portion.

/**
 * @typedef {NatValue | SetValue | CopySet | import('@endo/patterns').CopyBag} AmountValue
 *   An `AmountValue` describes a set or quantity of assets that can be owned or
 *   shared.
 *
 *   A fungible `AmountValue` uses a non-negative bigint to represent a quantity
 *   of that many assets.
 *
 *   A non-fungible `AmountValue` uses an array or CopySet of `Key`s to represent
 *   a set of whatever asset each key represents. A `Key` is a passable value
 *   that can be used as an element in a set (SetStore or CopySet) or as the key
 *   in a map (MapStore or CopyMap).
 *
 *   `SetValue` is for the deprecated set representation, using an array directly
 *   to represent the array of its elements. `CopySet` is the proper
 *   representation using a CopySet.
 *
 *   A semi-fungible `CopyBag` is represented as a `CopyBag` of `Key` objects.
 *   "Bag" is synonymous with MultiSet, where an element of a bag can be present
 *   once or more times, i.e., some positive bigint number of times,
 *   representing that quantity of the asset represented by that key.
