 * AmountMath executes the logic of how amounts are changed when digital
 * assets are merged, separated, or otherwise manipulated. For
 * example, a deposit of 2 bucks into a purse that already has 3 bucks
 * gives a new purse balance of 5 bucks. An empty purse has 0 bucks. AmountMath

/**
 * @typedef {NatValue | SetValue | CopySetValue | CopyBagValue} AmountValue
 * An `AmountValue` describes a set or quantity of assets that can be owned or
 * shared.
 *
 * A fungible `AmountValue` uses a non-negative bigint to represent a quantity
 * of that many assets.
 *
 * A non-fungible `AmountValue` uses an array or CopySet of `Key`s to represent
 * a set of whatever asset each key represents. A `Key` is a passable value
 * that can be used as an element in a set (SetStore or CopySet) or as the
 * key in a map (MapStore or CopyMap).
 *
 * `SetValue` is for the deprecated set representation, using an array directly
 * to represent the array of its elements. `CopySetValue` is the proper
 * representation using a CopySet.
 *
 * A semi-fungible `CopyBagValue` is represented as a
 * `CopyBag` of `Key` objects. "Bag" is synonymous with MultiSet, where an
 * element of a bag can be present once or more times, i.e., some positive
 * bigint number of times, representing that quantity of the asset represented
 * by that key.
