/**
 * As suggested by the name, this *mostly* represents a mathematical bijection,
 * i.e., a one-to-one mapping. But rather than a general bijection map store
 * (which would be interesting), this one is specialized to support the
 * async-flow replay-membrane, where the two sides are "guest" and "host".
 *
 * If `unwrap` is omitted, it defaults to an identity function on its
 * `guestWrapper` argument, in which case this does represent exactly a
 * mathematical bijection between host and guest.
 *
 * If `unwrap` is provided, it supports the unwrapping of guest wrappers, into
 * so-call unwrapped guests, like state records or functions,
 * that are not themselves `Passable`. This was motivated to support endowments,
 * which are often similar non-passables on the host-side.
 * However, it can support the unwrapping of any guest remotable wrapper.
 * When `unwrap` returns something `!==` its `guestWrapper` argument,
 * then we preserve the bijection (one-to-one mapping) between the host
 * and the unwrapped guest. To support the internal bookkeeping of the
 * replay-membrane, we also map the guestWrapper to that same host, but
 * not vice versa. Since the guest wrapper should not be visible outside
 * the replay-membrane, this extra bookkeeping should be invisible.
 *
 * This bijection only grows monotonically until reset, which clears the entire
 * mapping. Until reset, each pair, once entered, cannot be altered or deleted.
 * The mapping itself is completely ephemeral, but the bijection object itself
 * is durable. The mapping is also effectively reset by reincarnation, i.e,
 * on upgrade.
 * See also https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/9365
 *
 * To eventually address https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/9301
 * the bijection itself persists to support passing guest-created remotables
 * and promises through the membrane.
 * The resulting host wrappers must not only survive upgrade, then must
 * reestablish their mapping to the correct corresponding guest objects that
 * they are taken to wrap. We plan to do this via `equate` repopulating
 * the bijection by the time the host wrapper needs to know what
 * corresponding guest it is now taken to wrap.
 *
 * @param {Zone} zone
 * @param {(hostWrapper: PassableCap | Vow, guestWrapper: PassableCap) => unknown} [unwrap]
 *  defaults to identity function on `guestWrapper` arg
