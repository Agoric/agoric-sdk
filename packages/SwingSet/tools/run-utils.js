  // IMPORTANT WARNING TO USERS OF `EV`
  //
  // `EV` presents an abstraction that can be used (within tests only!) to get
  // much of the convenience with respect to messaging that `E` provides in
  // normal code.  However, this convenience comes with a huge caveat that all
  // users of this convenience feature MUST keep in mind.
  //
  // A test can drop messages onto the kernel's run queue using the
  // `controller.queueToVatRoot` and `controller.queueToVatObject` methods.
  // These are synchronous operations which merely place messages onto the run
  // queue without causing execution.  Execution, on the other hand, is
  // initiated by calling `controller.run`, which will cause the kernel to begin
  // delivering messages to vats from the run queue, continuing until the run
  // queue is exhausted.  HOWEVER, exhaustion of the run queue, which resolves
  // the result promise returned by the `run` call, IS NOT coupled in any causal
  // way to the resolution of result promises associated with the individual
  // queued messages themselves.  The status and resolution values of these
  // promises can be synchronously queried (by kpid) via the
  // `controller.kpStatus` and `controller.kpResolution` methods once `run` has
  // completed.  These queries are only available once the swingset has
  // reqlinquished agency, i.e., when the work initiated by `controller.run` has
  // finished.  At that point, nothing is going on inside the kernel, and
  // nothing WILL be going on inside the kernel until a subsequent call to
  // `controller.run`, which in turn will only have an effect if additional
  // messages have been placed on the kernel run queue in the meantime.  You MAY
  // NOT call `queueToVatRoot`, `queueToVatObject`, `kpStatus`, or
  // `kpResolution` while run queue execution, triggered by a call to `run`, is
  // in progress
  //
  // The functionality made available by `EV` looks similar to that provided by
  // `E`, but it is very much not.  When you send a message using `EV`, it
  // places the message onto the kernel run queue and then immediately invokes
  // `controller.run`.  When the result of `run` resolves, the kpid returned by
  // the message enqueueing operation is queried.  If at that time the promise
  // it identifies is resolved (or rejected), the value it was resolved (or
  // rejected) to is used as the result from the `EV` invocation.  However, if
  // it is still pending at that time, `EV` will throw an exception, which will
  // manifest as a rejection and your test will fail confusingly or abort.  This
  // means that if you initiate some operation via an `EV` message send, it must
  // complete within a single `run` cycle for it to be of any use to you.  This
  // is quite different from a message sent using `E`, which will return a
  // promise that can remain pending indefinitely, possibly to be settled by a
  // future message delivery.
