# All times are in seconds. The values in parentheses are a 20-block trailing
# average. For each block, the fields are:
#
#  blockTime: The delta between the consensus timestamps of this block and
#             the previous one (always an integer, since blockTime has low
#             resolution)
#  lag: Time elapsed from (consensus) blockTime to the BEGIN_BLOCK timestamp
#       in the slogfile. This includes the block proposer's timeout_commit delay,
#       network propagation to the monitoring node, and any local tendermint
#       verification.
#  cranks: The number of swingset cranks performed in the block.
#  computrons: The total computrons of execution performed in the block. The
#              current run-policy stops doing cranks when this exceeds 8M. In
#              the above example, block 74085 exceeded the (current) 8M
#              computron run-policy limit, so some of the 57 cranks executed
#              in block 74086 were leftovers from 74085.
#  swingset: The amount of time spent in the kernel for this block. This is
#            from cosmic-swingset-end-block-start to -end-block-finish
#  cosmos: The amount of time spent in non-swingset block work. This is from
#          cosmic-swingset-begin-block to -end-block-start, and includes all
#          cosmos-sdk modules like Bank and Staking.
#  proc%: The percentage of time spent doing block processing, out of the total
#         time from one block to the next. 100% means the monitoring node has
#         no idle time between blocks, and is probably falling behind.

# If enabled, this tool will also run `ag-chain-cosmos` to learn about
# consensus-protocol details for each block, which will populate additional
# fields:
#
# [sigs2/3/tot]: The number of signatures on the block, of type 2 ("COMMIT")
#                or type 3 ("NIL"), and the total of both. Tendermint docs at
#                https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/HEAD/spec/core/data_structures.md#blockidflag
#                might provide an interpretation of these flags. If the
#                number of signatures drops, it might indicate that
#                validators are falling behind and were unable to deliver
#                their signature in time to be counted.
# rounds: The number of proposal rounds that were necessary to select a
#         block. Normally this is 0, but if a block proposer did not provide
#         a block fast enough, or if 2/3rds of the voting power did not
#         approve it fast enough, more rounds may be needed, and this field
#         will show "r1" or "r2" or higher. Elevated round counts may
#         indicate that the proposer, or validators, are falling behind.
# proposer: The moniker (if available via keys.txt) or abbreviated address of
#           the validator which proposed this block.
