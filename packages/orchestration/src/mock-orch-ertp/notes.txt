ub = unencumbered balance (purse "currentAmount")

fb = full balance = eb + ub (orch acct balance)

s = source

ertp withdraw(a)
  ub -= a
  eb += a
  fb unchanged

ertp deposit(a)
  sub unchanged
  seb -= a
  sfb -= a
  once transfer succeeds
    dub += a
    deb unchanged
    dfb += a
  once transfer fails
    sub += a
    seb unchanged from above
    sfb += a (net sfb unchanged)

ertp burn(a) (like a successful deposit to dev/null)
  ub unchanged
  eb -= a
  fb -= a

ertp reclaim(a), like a successful self.deposit(a)
  ub += a
  eb -= a
  fb unchanged

mintTo(d, a), like succeed case of transfer
  dub += a
  deb unchanged
  dfb += a

if orch account can be independently spent from
  ub can go negative, if fb < eb
  payments can fail to be deposited
