/**
 * This contract is inspired by the description of an OTC Desk smart
 * contract in this article:
 * https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/unbundling-uniswap-the-future-of-on-chain-market-making-1c7d6948d570
 *
 * The creator of this contract instance can take three actions: add
 * inventory, remove inventory, and make quotes for potential trading
 * partners.
 *
 * To add inventory, the creator of the contract instance can call
 * `E(creatorFacet).makeAddInventoryInvitation(issuerKeywordRecord)`
 * and receive an invitation to add inventory. In this call, they must
 * pass in an issuerKeywordRecord of any issuers they wish to add
 * inventory for, if these issuers have not yet been saved to ZCF.
 * When actually escrowing the inventory as an offer, the proposal
 * must not `want` anything. All of the newly escrowed inventory is
 * taken and reallocated to the marketMakerSeat in the contract.
 *
 * To remove inventory, the creator of the contract instance can call
 * `E(creatorFacet).makeRemoveInventoryInvitation()` and receive an
 * invitation to remove inventory. When making an offer to remove
 * inventory, the proposal should specify the `want`, which will be
 * removed, but should not give anything.
 *
 * To make a quote, the creator can call
 * `E(creatorFacet).makeQuote(price, assets, timeAuthority,
 * deadline)`. `price` and `assets` are amountKeywordRecords that will
 * be used in the coveredCall. The assets are the underlyingAssets in
 * the call option, and the price is used as the strikePrice. The
 * timeAuthority should be a timer, and the deadline can be any time
 * understood by the timer. The quote will be cancelled after the
 * deadline. `makeQuote` returns a covered call option that can be
 * given away for free or sold. Importantly, if the recipient chooses
 * to exercise the option, they can verify that the goods being
 * offered are already escrowed, and the trade is guaranteed to
 * succeed if their proposal matches the quote.
 *
