/**
 * This contract implements a fully collateralized call spread. This is a
 * combination of a call option bought at one strike price and a second call
 * option sold at a higher price. The invitations are produced in pairs, and the
 * instance creator escrows upfront all collateral that will be paid out. The
 * individual options are ERTP invitations that are suitable for resale.
 *
 * This option contract is settled financially. There is no requirement that the
 * creator have ownership of the underlying asset at the start, and
 * the beneficiaries shouldn't expect to take delivery at closing.
 *
 * The issuerKeywordRecord specifies the issuers for three keywords: Underlying,
 * Strike, and Collateral. The payout is in Collateral. Strike amounts are used
 * for the price oracle's quotes as to the value of the Underlying, as well as
 * the strike prices in the terms.
 *
 * The creatorInvitation has customDetails that include the amounts of the
 * two options as longAmount and shortAmount. When the creatorInvitation is
 * exercised, the payout includes the two option positions, which are themselves
 * invitations which can be exercised for free, and provide the option payouts
 * with the keyword Collateral.
 *
 * terms include:
 * `timer` is a timer, and must be recognized by `priceAuthority`.
 * `expiration` is a time recognized by the `timer`.
 * `underlyingAmount` is passed to `priceAuthority`. It could be an NFT or a
 *   fungible amount.
 * `strikePrice2` must be greater than `strikePrice1`.
 * `settlementAmount` is the amount deposited by the funder and split between
 *   the holders of the options. It uses Collateral.
 * `priceAuthority` is an oracle that has a timer so it can respond to requests
 *   for prices as of a stated time. After the deadline, it will issue a
 *   PriceQuote giving the value of the underlying asset in the strike currency.
 *
 * Future enhancements:
 * + issue multiple option pairs with the same expiration from a single instance
 * + increase the precision of the calculations. (use Ratios with
 *   denominator.value=10000)
