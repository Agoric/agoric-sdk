/**
 * This is a very simple contract that creates a new issuer and mints payments
 * from it, in order to give an example of how that can be done.  This contract
 * sends new tokens to anyone who has an invitation.
 *
 * The expectation is that most contracts that want to do something similar
 * would use the ability to mint new payments internally rather than sharing
 * that ability widely as this one does.
 *
 * To pay others in tokens, the creator of the instance can make
 * invitations for them, which when used to make an offer, will payout
 * the specified amount of tokens.
