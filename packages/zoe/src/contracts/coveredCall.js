/**
 * A call option is the right (but not the obligation) to buy digital
 * assets at a pre-determined price, called the strike price. This
 * call option is "covered," meaning that the owner of the digital
 * assets must put the assets in escrow. This guarantees that the
 * assets can be transferred without relying on the owner of the
 * digital assets to keep their promise.
 *
 * https://agoric.com/documentation/zoe/guide/contracts/covered-call.html
 *
 * The call option has an expiration date, when the opportunity is
 * cancelled. The owner of the digital assets cannot remove the assets
 * from escrow before the expiration date.
 *
 * The `creatorInvitation` of this contract is an invitation to escrow
 * the underlying assets. The proposal to escrow assets can have any
 * `give` and `want` with any keywords. Any number of assets of
 * different brands can be escrowed under different keywords. The
 * proposal must have an exit record with the key "afterDeadline":
 * {
 *    give: { ... },
 *    want: { ... },
 *    exit: {
 *      afterDeadline: { deadline: time, timer: myTimer }
 *    },
 * }
 *
 * This deadline serves as the expiration date for the covered call
 * option. After this deadline, if the option has not been exercised,
 * the underlying assets are automatically paid out to the creator of
 * the contract as a refund.
 *
 * After the owner of the digital assets escrows the assets in the
 * initial offer, they receive a seat. The payout for this seat will
 * either be a refund of the underlying assets (as mentioned above) or
 * payments in the amount of the strike price. Zoe's enforcement of
 * offer safety guarantees that the payout is either a refund or
 * payments in the amount of the strike price, regardless of whether
 * this contract is buggy.
 *
 * The offerResult of this initial seat resolves to the call option
 * itself: an inspectable invitation to buy the underlying assets. The
 * call option invitation has this additional information in the
 * value: {expirationDate, timeAuthority, underlyingAssets,
 * strikePrice }
 *
 * The invitation itself can be traded as a valuable digital asset: a
 * covered call option.
 *
 * The recipient of a covered call option (buying it on some other
 * exchange or through some other trading contract) can exercise the
 * option before the deadline by using the option as an invitation to
 * this contract, paying the strike price and receiving the underlying
 * assets. The recipient of a covered call option can use whatever
 * keywords they wish, as long as they give the strike price as
 * specified in the invitation value, and want the underlying assets
 * exactly.
