/**
 * @typedef {(seat1: ZCFSeat, seat2: ZCFSeat, ...seatRest:
 * Array<ZCFSeat>) => void} Reallocate
 *
 * The contract can reallocate over seats, which commits the staged
 * allocation for each seat. On commit, the staged allocation becomes
 * the current allocation and the staged allocation is deleted.
 *
 * The reallocation will only succeed if the reallocation 1) conserves
 * rights (the amounts specified have the same total value as the
 * current total amount), and 2) is 'offer-safe' for all parties
 * involved. All seats that have staged allocations must be included
 * as arguments to `reallocate`, or an error is thrown. Additionally,
 * an error is thrown if any seats included in `reallocate` do not
 * have a staged allocation.
 *
 * The reallocation is partial, meaning that it applies only to the
 * seats passed in as arguments. By induction, if rights conservation
 * and offer safety hold before, they will hold after a safe
 * reallocation, even though we only re-validate for the seats whose
 * allocations will change. Since rights are conserved for the change,
 * overall rights will be unchanged, and a reallocation can only
 * effect offer safety for seats whose allocations change.
