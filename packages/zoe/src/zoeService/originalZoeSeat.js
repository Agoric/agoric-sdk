 * declareOldZoeSeatAdminKind declares an exo for the original kind of ZoeSeatKit.

 * because it goes through weakMaps in two different Vats. We've defined a new
 * Kind that doesn't have this problem, but we won't upgrade the existing
 * objects, so the Kind must continue to be defined, but we don't return the
 * maker function.
 *
 * The original ZoeSeatKit is an object that manages the state
 * of a seat participating in a Zoe contract and return its two facets.
 *
 * The UserSeat is suitable to be handed to an agent outside zoe and the
 * contract and allows them to query or monitor the current state, access the
 * payouts and result, and call exit() if that's allowed for this seat.
 *
 * The zoeSeatAdmin is passed by Zoe to the ContractFacet (zcf), to allow zcf to
 * query or update the allocation or exit the seat cleanly.
