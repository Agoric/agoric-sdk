 * NO on the question. The voters can only get the capability to vote
 * by making an offer using a voter invitation and escrowing assets. The
 * brand of assets is determined on contract instantiation through an
 * issuerKeywordRecord. The instantiator gets the only Secretary
 * access through the creatorFacet.
