# Fast USDC

Contracts for the Fast USDC product. Here in agoric-sdk as a convenience for
integration testing and iterating on the SDK affordances required for the product.

# Transaction feed

## Oracles interface

Oracles run off-chain and interact with the contract via an Agoric smart wallet bridge.

### State Diagram

*Transactions are qualified by the OCW and TransactionFeed before being
delivered to the Advancer.*

The transactionFeed receives attestations from Oracles, records their
evidence, and when enough oracles agree, (if no risks are identified)
it publishes the results for the advancer to act on.

The Advancer subscribes (via `handleTransactionEvent`) to events published by
the transactionFeed. When notified of an appropriate opportunity, it is
responsible for advancing funds to fastUSDC payees.

The Settler is responsible for monitoring (via `receiveUpcall`) deposits to the
settlementAccount. It either `disburse`s funds to the Pool (if funds were
`advance`d to the payee), or `forwards` funds to the payee (if pool funds
were not `advance`d).
