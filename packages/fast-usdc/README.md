# Fast USDC

Development package for the Fast USDC product. Here in agoric-sdk as a
convenience for integration testing and iterating on the SDK affordances
required for the product.

# Factoring

This package is meant to contain all the code for the Fast USDC product.
However, there are some constraints:

- a3p integration tests are in the `a3p-integration` top-level package, separate
    from this workspace
- the proposal builders are in `@agoric/builders` to work with the
    a3p-integration `build:submissions` script
- the RunUtils tests are in `@aglocal/boot` to test running them atop a fresh
    bootstrapped environment

Over time we can update our tooling to decouple this more from the `packages` directory.

1. Make a3p-integration `build:submissions` script work with arbitrary builder
    paths, allowing this to be above `@agoric/builders` in the package graph
2. Export bootstrap testing utilities from `@aglocal/boot`, allowing this to be
    above `@aglocal/boot` in the package graph
3. Update CI to support packages that aren't under `packages/`, eg. a top-level
   `dapps` directory. `multichain-testing` does this now but not organized per contract.
4. Move this package out of agoric-sdk
