# usage of TypeScript

Our use of TypeScript has to accommodate both .js development in agoric-sdk (which could not import types until TS 5.5) and .ts development of consumers of agoric-sdk packages (which could always import types). For .js development, we have many ambient (global) types so that we don't have to precede each type reference by an import. For .ts development, we want exports from modules so we don't pollute a global namespace. We are slowly transitioning away from ambient types.

## Best practices

### Exported types

- `.ts` for modules defining exported types
- package entrypoint(s) exports explicit types
- use `/** @import ` comments to import types without getting the runtime module

### Ambient types

- `.d.ts` for modules defining ambient types
- import types using [triple-slash reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html#-reference-types-)
- for packages upon which other packages expect ambient types:
  - `exported.js` supplies ambients
- don't use runtime imports to get types ([issue](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/6512))

## .ts modules

We cannot use `.ts` files in any modules that are transitively imported into an Endo bundle. The reason is that the Endo bundler doesn't understand `.ts` syntax and we don't want it to until we have sufficient auditability of the transformation. Moreover we've tried to avoid a build step in order to import a module. (The one exception so far is `@agoric/cosmic-proto` because we codegen the types. Those modules are written in `.ts` syntax and build to `.js` by a build step that creates `dist`, which is the package export.)

The trick is to use `.ts` for defining types and then make them available in the packages using a `types-index` module that has both `.js` and `.d.ts` files.

**Entrypoint (index.js)**
```js
// eslint-disable-next-line import/export
export * from './src/types-index.js'; // no named exports
```

**types-index.js**
```js
// Empty JS file to correspond with its .d.ts twin
export {};
```

**types-index.d.ts**
```ts
// Export all the types this package provides
export * from './types.js';
export * from './other-types.js';
```

The actual type implementation is then written in `types.ts` and `other-types.ts` files (per the example above).
These files are never runtime imported as they are only linked through a `.d.ts` file.


## d.ts modules

We take on the complexity above of indirection because `.d.ts` files aren't checked. We have `"skipLibCheck": true"` in the root tsconfig.json because some libraries we depend on have their own type errors. (A massive one is the output of Telescope, used in `@agoric/cosmic-proto`.)

This means that the types you write in `.d.ts` file won't be checked by `tsc`. To gain some confidence, you can temporarily flip that setting in a package's own `tsconfig.json` and pay attention to only the relevant errors.

## entrypoint

This is usually an `index.js` file which contains a wildcard export like,

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line import/export -- just types
export * from './src/types.js';
```

The `types.js` file either defines the types itself or is an empty file (described above) paired with a `.d.ts` or `.ts` twin.

One option considered is having the conditional package `"exports"` include `"types"` but that has to be a .d.ts file. That could be generated from a `.ts` but it would require a build step, which we've so far avoided.

Once we have [JSDoc export type support](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/48104) we'll be able instead to keep the `index.js` entrypoint and have it export the types from `.ts` files without a runtime import of the module containing them.

## exported.js

The `exported.js` re-exports types into global namespace, for consumers that expect these to
be ambient. This could be called "ambient.js" but we retain the filename for backwards compatibility.

The pattern is to make these two files like this at package root:

`exported.js`

```ts
// Dummy file for .d.ts twin to declare ambients
export {};
```

`exported.d.ts`

```ts
/** @file Ambient exports until https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/6512 */
/** @see {@link /docs/typescript.md} */
/* eslint-disable -- doesn't understand .d.ts */
import {
  SomeType as _SomeType,
} from './src/types.js';

declare global {
  export {
    _SomeType as SomeType,
  };
}
```

Why the _ prefix? Because without it TS gets confused between the
import and export symbols. ([h/t](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66588974))
Note one downside vs ambients is that these types will appear to be on `globalThis`.

## Generating API docs

We use [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) to render API docs in HTML.

```sh
yarn docs
open api-docs/index.html
```
