# Start from the published Noble image
FROM ghcr.io/noble-assets/noble:v9.0.4

# Switch to root so we can install packages
USER root

# Install bash (this image is Alpine-based)
RUN apk add --no-cache bash

# (Optional) switch back to the non-root user if needed
# USER nobled

# Ensure the default entrypoint/command are preserved:
# you don’t need to set ENTRYPOINT or CMD here,
# it’ll inherit whatever the noble image has.
