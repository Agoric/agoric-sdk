# Starship 

End-to-end testing environment for fully simulated chains, powered by [Starship](https://docs.cosmology.zone/starship).

## Configuration

The current commands will read from [`config.yaml`](./config.yaml) to build a multi-chain testing environment. Currently, the image includes `agoric`, `osmosis`, and `cosmoshub` chains and a hermes relayer between each.

The `agoric` software revision includes the vats necessary for building and testing orchestration applications:
- vat-network
- vat-ibc
- vat-localchain
- vat-transfer
- vat-orchestration

## Initial Setup

Install the relevant dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

Ensure you have Kubernetes available. See https://docs.cosmology.zone/starship/get-started/step-2.

The following will install `kubectl`, `kind`, `helm`, and `yq` as needed:

```sh
make clean setup
```

## Getting Started

You can start everything with a single command:

```sh
make start
```

This command will:
1. Install the Helm chart and start the Starship service
2. Wait for all pods to be ready
3. Set up port forwarding
4. Fund the provision pool
5. Override the chain registry

The process may take 7-12 minutes to complete. You'll see status updates as the pods come online.

Alternatively, you can run the steps individually:

```sh
# install helm chart and start starship service
make install

# wait for all pods to spin up
make wait-for-pods

# expose ports on your local machine (useful for testing dapps)
make port-forward

# set up Agoric testing environment
make fund-provision-pool override-chain-registry
```

If you get an error like "connection refused", you need to wait longer, until all the pods are Running.

## Cleanup

```sh
# stop the containers and port-forwarding
make stop

# delete the clusters
make clean
```

## Logs

You can use the following commands to view logs:

```sh
# agoric slogfile
make tail-slog

# agoric validator logs
kubectl logs agoriclocal-genesis-0 --container=validator --follow

# relayer logs
kubectl logs hermes-agoric-gaia-0 --container=relayer --follow
kubectl logs hermes-osmosis-gaia-0 --container=relayer --follow
```

## Agoric Smart Wallet

For the steps below, you must import a key to `agd` or create a new one.

```bash
# create a `user1` key from a random seed
kubectl exec -i agoriclocal-genesis-0 -c validator -- agd keys add user1

# get the newly created address
ADDR=$(kubectl exec -i agoriclocal-genesis-0 -c validator -- agd keys show user1 -a)

# fund the wallet with some tokens 
make fund-wallet COIN=20000000ubld ADDR=$ADDR

# provision the smart wallet
make provision-smart-wallet ADDR=$ADDR
```

## Chain Registry

These only work if you've done `make port-forward`.
