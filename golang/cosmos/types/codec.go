	// The na√Øve json.Marshal output for an int64 (64-bit precision) is a JS
	// number (only 53-bit precision), which is subject to rounding errors on the
	// JS side.  The codec.ProtoCodec uses a custom JSON marshaller that converts
	// int64s to and from strings with no loss of precision.

	// The current package's IBCPacket was one such affected data structure, which
	// now implements Marshaler and Unmarshaler interfaces for "encoding/json" to
	// take advantage of the packageCdc.
